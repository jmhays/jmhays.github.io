I originally trained as a physicist, completing my undergraduate degree at William and Mary, before joining [Peter Kasson's group](https://kassonlab.wordpress.com/) as a graduate student at the University of Virginia. I uses molecular dynamics simulations to both guide and incorporate spectroscopic measurements to understand flexible conformational ensembles. I am currently supported by a [MolSSI Software Fellowship](https://molssi.org/2018/08/20/changing-the-world-one-fellow-at-a-time/). I love statistical mechanics, Python, and [containerizing](https://hub.docker.com/u/jmhays) the heck out of my [software](https://github.com/jmhays)!
